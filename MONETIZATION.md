## Legal Considerations

### Open-Source + Commercial
- ✅ You can sell add-ons to MIT-licensed software
- ✅ You can offer commercial hosting
- ✅ You can sell themes/templates
- ❌ Don't change core license retroactively
- ✅ Be transparent: "Core is free, premium features cost money"

### Recommended licenses:
- **Core project:** MIT (current)
- **Premium themes:** Commercial license
- **Hosted SaaS:** Terms of Service + Privacy Policy

1. **Product Hunt** - Launch themes/hosted version
2. **Indie Hackers** - Share revenue journey
3. **Twitter/X** - Build in public
4. **Dev.to** - Technical tutorials
5. **YouTube** - Setup tutorials
6. **SEO** - "free contact form", "typeform alternative"
7. **Reddit** - r/SideProject, r/webdev
